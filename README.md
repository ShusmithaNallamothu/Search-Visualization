This project is about web application for analyzing and visualizing graph search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's).

FEATURES: 
	--> Input graph data and specify source & destination nodes.
	--> Compare BFS, DFS and Dijkstra's Algorithm.
	--> Visualize paths and traversal outcomes on the graph.
	--> Calculate and display the cost associated with each technique.

PURPOSE:
	--> Assist students, researchers, and enthusiasts in understanding algorithmic trade-offs and efficiencies in graph theory.
	--> Provides insights into how these methods work and when each might be most effective.

EASY INTEGRATION STEPS:
	1.Create a Project Directory
	2.Clone into your project
	3.Navigate to your project by using terminal
	4.Run pip install -r requirements.txt
	5.Run the code (python app.py or flask run)
	6.And you can access the web application.

THE LIBRARIES I USED:
1.Flask
	-->It is used to build for User Interface for web applications and also handles HTTP requests, route URLs to Python functions and more...

2.Flask-Bootstrap
	-->It is an extension that integrates Bootstrap, Bootstrap provides pre-styled components (like buttons, forms, navigation bars) and responsive layouts, enhancing the UI design of the web application.

3.Networkx
	-->It is used for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks or graphs.

4.Matplotlib
	-->It makes easy things easy and hard things possible, offers a wide range of plotting tools for generating graphs, charts, histograms, scatter plots, etc., which are crucial for data visualization and analysis.
